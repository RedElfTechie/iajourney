# Industrial Automation 4.0 Journey

This documentation repository serves as the learning journey I have done while interfacing and building Industrial Automation module. 

At current stage, we are exploring the usage of Sysmac Studio, OMRON PLC and UA Server.

# Sysmac Studio

Sysmac Studio is a Windows software used for interfacing with OMRON
PLC. With the software, the user is able to configure and program the
OMRON PLC. More information can be found in the subsequent folder.
